This is the official guide for KDE 4 related threads.

KDE 4 for Gentoo is delivered in several ways:
[list]
[*][b][url=http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Portage]Portage repository[/url][/b]
The only officially supported and recommended way to get
[url=http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-4.4.4.php]KDE4 (4.4.4 recently)[/url].
If you haven't used any [url=http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Portage_Overlay]overlay[/url]
nor compiled KDE 4 from source manually - this is probably what you're looking for.
KDE 4 portage guide can be found

to avoid problems in a future, it's is advised that you checked FAQ below as well.

[size=18]KDE in Portage - FAQ[/size]

[color=orange]Q:[/color] What's the deal with [b]kdeprefix[/b] USE flag and why is it
masked?

[b]A:[/b] [b]kdeprefix[/b] USE flag allows installing KDE4 in alternate location, thus
making it possible to have multiple KDE4 releases side by side. Note that this is not
needed to have KDE3 installed as well. Because having multiple KDE4 installations has
known issues like bugs [bug=258027]258027[/bug] or [bug=267793]267793[/bug], it's not
ready for public consumption hence it's been disabled by default.


[color=orange]Q:[/color] I want to run amarok, but all I get is "symbol lookup error:
/usr/kde/live/lib64/kde4/plugins/styles/oxygen.so: undefined symbol". What should I do?

[b]A:[/b] It's a Qt bug that appears when using [b]kdeprefix[/b] USE flag. Qt plugin
loader appends "qtplugins" path from currently running KDE4 session, causing oxygen.so
from wrong KDE prefix to be dlopen'ed. Unfortunately it as well cashes plugin locations in
[color=blue]~/.config/Trolltech.conf[/color], making it permanently broken unless the file
is removed. It usually happens with amarok or any other KDE4 applications installed in no
prefix ([color=blue]/usr[/color]), that are built against existing KDE4 in one prefix (for
example [color=blue]/usr/kde/4.2[/color]), but run from the other (for example in Gnome,
KDE3 or [color=blue]/usr/kde/live[/color]). For now there's no known solution.


[color=orange]Q:[/color] Why there are no sets for KDE4?

[b]A:[/b] KDE4 so far is NOT making use of sets but sets are expected to arrive in near
future - the reason is - the naming convention for sets is not yet established. Although
KDE4 Gentoo team prepared some sets for you
[url=http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/kde.git;a=tree;f=sets;h=
829bc933b1e43e13133dcd6f9c2c2c5566569315;hb=master]here[/url] (click 'raw' to download
file and place in [color=blue]/etc/portage/sets/[/color]). An archive with all sets can be
downloaded from
[url=http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=proj/kde.git;a=snapshot;h=
829bc933b1e43e13133dcd6f9c2c2c5566569315;sf=tgz]here[/url]. Remember that you are using
them at your own risk.


[color=orange]Q:[/color] When I start KDE 3, Plasma is being executed and my KDE 3
applications are either crashing or just not working. Konqueror refuses to start,
complaining about default stylesheet version mismatch. What's going on?

[b]A:[/b] This is the conflict related to mixed KDE3/KDE4 sessions. To fix this issue you
need to [url=http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/desktop/kde/kde-split-ebuilds.xml]upgrade[/url]
your existing KDE 3.5.x installations to 3.5.10 or newer. Note that the 3.5.10 series has
not been given stable keywords yet and that the monolithic packages have been
discontinued.


[color=orange]Q:[/color] I installed KDE4, I can start my desktop using startx but KDM is
not working. Please help.

[b]A:[/b] First, ensure that [color=blue]kdm[/color] executable is in your [i]PATH[/i]. To
check that, run:
[code]which kdm[/code]
If it's not found, then probably your environment is not up to date. To update it, run:
[code]env-update && source /etc/profile[/code]
When [color=blue]kdm[/color] is found, set [i]DISPLAYMANAGER="kdm"[/i] variable in
[color=blue]/etc/conf.d/xdm[/color]. From now on, KDM should be working.


[color=orange]Q:[/color] I just found this neat KDE4 application, can you make an ebuild
for it?

[b]A:[/b] In short, no. To be more precise, it is possible but it would be better if you
[url=http://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing]created ebuild[/url] for it and send it
Gentoo KDE team for review - it's more likely it will be added to overlay. The best
procedure would be to create [url=https://bugs.gentoo.org]bug[/url] with ebuild proposal
(if it's not there already) and inform the developers on
[url=irc://irc.freenode.net/gentoo-kde]#gentoo-kde[/url] about it:
[quote]Hi, i found this nice app blablu v 14.2 i opened bug 234556 for it. Please could
you consider adding it to kde-testing?[/quote]

If you have any suggestions for improvements regarding this guide, feel free to post them
[topic=708322]here[/topic]. Please refrain from general discussion and do not post
ebuild/installation questions there.
